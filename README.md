# My Portfolio
A webpage designed to be my portfolio to showcase information about myself. 

## Description
This code was created as part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path Module 15 Portfolio Website. </br>
For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that youâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.

            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Northumbria University in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. 
                Since graduating, I have worked in different laboatories both in Scotland and in the North West of England. 
                In Scotland, I worked manufacturing peptides for use in individualised clinical trial cancer vaccinations.
                Back in England, I worked on the development of different disease indications working as a scientist for a Biotech company.
